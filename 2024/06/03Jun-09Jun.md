  - what was interesting was this snippet "They use the same technique I describe in this blog post except they need a specific WIN://SYSAPPID, for example "MicrosoftWindows.Client.AIX_cw5n1h2txyewy". You can get a token for this attribute by opening the instance of AIXHost.exe, getting its token and using that to access the database files. Or, as the files are owned by the user you can just rewrite the DACLs for the files and gain access that way, no admin required"
  - windows app folder contains packaged applications; if you know the exact name you can view it
  - "his guess seems likely because if you know the name of the packaged application there's nothing stopping you listing it's contents, it's only the top level WindowsApps folder which is blocked"
  - turns out that although BUILTIN\Users group should get read and execute access, it only works if the WIN://SYSAPPID security attribute exists in the user's access token.
  - "There are various ways around this but the simplest is to start the process suspended, then use NtSetInformationProcess to swap the token to the one with the attribute. Setting the token after creation does not strip the attributes."
